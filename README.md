# Know-It!

Know-It is an interactive platform where students could share and access study materials efficiently. By allowing users to upload their own notes and convert them into quizzes, we aim to make learning more engaging and personalized. This approach leverages the community's collective knowledge, enhancing the study experience for everyone involved. We envisioned a tool that not only facilitates individual learning but also encourages collaboration among peers.
